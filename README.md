==========
A flexible game engine for PyGame projects.

## Features
* Wrapper classes that make handling graphics and audio within games
  unified and non-trivial.
* Quick and easy resource management to make sure that no file is
  loaded twice.
* Component-based Entity system allows game objects to possess any
  unique properties and behaviours you can come up with.
* Other quirks in game development - such as state management and
  screen drawing - are taken care of, leaving you to focus on the
  design of your game.

## How to Use
For now, you can include this library within your PyGame project
directory and import whichever classes and modules you may need.
Installation setup will be out sometime in the future.

## How to Contribute
This is an ongoing project with the potential for extended capabilities
beyond what was originally envisioned. Bug fixes, refactoring, and
extending features and classes are all welcome - just send us your
modified branch in a pull request and it will be considered.
