GameWrappy
==========
Asset handling and wrapper classes for PyGame.

## Features
* Wrapper classes that make handling graphics and audio within game
  engines unified and non-trivial.
* Quick and easy resource management to make sure that no file is
  loaded twice.

## License
See [UNLICENSE.txt](UNLICENSE.txt).

## How to Use
For now, you can include this library within your PyGame project
directory and import whichever classes and modules you may need.
Installation setup will be out sometime in the future.

## How to Contribute
This is an ongoing project with the potential for extended capabilities
past what was originally envisioned. Bug fixes, refactoring, and
extending features and classes are all welcome - just send us your
modified branch in a pull request and it will be considered.
